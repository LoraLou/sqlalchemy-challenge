Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data:

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to conduct analysis on the precipitation and the stations located in Hawaii. I used Pandas to create summary statistics. Images are included to represent the data. The first image shows precipitation in Hawaii by date and the second image shows the temperature over the last 12 months for the stations with the most data.

Part 2: Design Your Climate App:

I designed a Flask API with the data.
